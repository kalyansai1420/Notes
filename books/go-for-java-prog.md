## Part 1 : First Look at Go

### A brief look a Go vs. Java

- In java we use Ant or Maven
- In Go we use Go builder tool


| Go     | Java      |
| -------- | ------- |
|  Go builder Tool | Ant or Maven    |
| structs |  Classes    |
| base declarations & derived type declarations | only type declarations |
| full closures(can capture mutable data) |  partial closures(can cpature only immutable data)|
| lacks user-defined generic types |  supports generic types of any reference type |
| allows type extension of only other types | base new types on any exisitng type |

# Go

## Basics

- statically typed
  - means all variables must have a defined type at compile-time
- compiled programming language
- major language features
  - Packages
  - Functions
  - Variables

```sh
const OvenTime = 40
var closed bool // boolean variable 'closed' implicitly initalized with 'false'
speeding := true //boolean varibale 'speeding' initialized with 'true'
hasError := false // boolean variable 'hasError' initialized with 'false'
```

- Converting between types
  
```sh
var x int = 42
f := float64(x)
var y float64 = 11.9
i := int(y)


var x int = 42
value := float32(2.0) * float32(x)
```

- String

```sh
"Jane" + " " + "Austen"
```
